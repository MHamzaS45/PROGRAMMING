# Week 3 — Fundamentals: Functions, Data Structures & String Processing

Overview
This week focuses on breaking problems into reusable pieces (functions) and using core data structures and string methods. The tasks provide practice working with lists and strings, writing functions, and organizing code.

Included files
- Week3/#A3_Task2.py
- Week3/A3 Task 4.py
- Week3/A3 Task5.py
- Week3/A3 Task6.py
- Week3/A3 Task7.py
- Week3/A3_Task1.py

What these exercises focus on
- Defining and calling functions with parameters and return values
- Working with lists: indexing, slicing, appending, iteration
- String processing: splitting, joining, searching, formatting
- Using helper functions to simplify main program logic
- Basic data validation and error handling within functions

How to run
- Execute scripts as usual: python "Week3/A3_Task1.py"
- If a task defines functions intended to be imported, you can also run them from an interactive session or a small driver script.

Notes and learning goals
- Practice writing clear function docstrings and choosing good function names.
- Prefer pure functions where possible (functions that avoid modifying global state).
- Use list comprehensions for concise transformations when appropriate.
