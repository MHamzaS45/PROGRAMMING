# Week 5 — Fundamentals: (Directory listing unavailable; template)

Overview
A README template for Week 5 is provided below. The directory listing for Week 5 was not available at the time this file was created, so the specific exercise filenames are left as placeholders. Replace the placeholders with the actual filenames in the Week 5 folder.

Placeholder file list
- Week 5/<insert_filename_1>.py
- Week 5/<insert_filename_2>.py
- Week 5/<insert_filename_3>.py

Suggested topics these exercises usually cover
- Intermediate control flow and data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- Functions and modularization, possibly brief introduction to modules and packages
- File input/output or basic error/exception handling (common mid-course topics)

How to adapt this README
- Replace the placeholder filenames above with the real filenames present in Week 5.
- For each file, add a one-line description of the exercise and the primary programming fundamentals it practices.

Notes and learning goals
- Once the actual file list is added, include a short "How to run" section per script and any sample inputs or expected outputs.
