# Week 2 — Fundamentals: Conditionals & Loops

Overview
This week develops control flow skills: using conditionals to make decisions and loops to repeat operations. The tasks typically combine conditional logic with iteration and may include simple algorithms.

Included files
- Week2/A2 Task 7.py
- Week2/A2 Task5.py
- Week2/A2 Task6.py
- Week2/Task1.py

What these exercises focus on
- if / elif / else branching to handle multiple cases
- for and while loops for iteration
- Combining loops and conditionals (e.g., searching, counting)
- Using break and continue appropriately
- Simple validation of user input

How to run
- Run each script with Python, e.g.: python "Week2/A2 Task 7.py"
- Test edge cases (empty input, boundary values) to confirm logic handles them.

Notes and learning goals
- Understand logical operators (and, or, not) and short-circuit evaluation.
- Practice writing clear, well-indented conditional blocks and loop bodies.
- Aim to keep functions small and focused if tasks include helper functions.
