# Week 6 — Fundamentals: File Handling

Overview
Week 6 contains tasks focused on practical program structures that often involve reading/writing data and combining functions/data structures to solve problems.

What these exercises focus on
- Organizing code with functions and possibly simple modules
- Reading from and writing to files (file I/O) and processing file contents
- Using lists and dictionaries to collect and transform data
- Implementing small algorithms and data transformations

How to run
- Run scripts normally: python "Week 6/A6 T1.py"
- If a script depends on input files, ensure those files are available in the expected relative path.

Notes and learning goals
- Practice robust file handling (using with open(...) as f).
- Validate input data read from files before processing.
- Keep data parsing logic isolated in functions for easier testing.
