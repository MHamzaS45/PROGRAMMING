# Week 1 — Fundamentals: Variables, Data Types & Basic I/O

Overview
This week contains introductory exercises that practice the basic building blocks of Python programs: variables, primitive data types, arithmetic operations, string handling, and simple input/output.

Included files
- Week1/A1 Task 5.py
- Week1/A1 Task 6.py

What these exercises focus on
- Declaring and using variables (integers, floats, strings)
- Performing arithmetic and using operators
- Reading input from the user with input()
- Formatting and printing output
- Basic string operations and conversion between types

How to run
- From the command line: python "Week1/A1 Task 5.py"
- Ensure you run each script in a terminal so interactive input() prompts work correctly.

Notes and learning goals
- Pay attention to type conversion (int(), float(), str()) when combining values.
- Practice both formatted printing (f-strings) and concatenation.
- These tasks are intended to build confidence with program flow and user interaction.
