# Week 7 — Fundamentals: Data Structures (Dictionary, Lists, Tuples)


 topics these exercises  cover
- More advanced uses of data structures (nested lists/dictionaries, tuples),
- Understand the differences and when to use certain data structures
- Applied projects that combine prior topics (functions, classes, file I/O), 
- Introduction to modules, simple testing, or basic algorithms.

How to adapt this README
- Replace the placeholder filenames above with the real filenames present in Week 7.
- For each file, add a one-line description of the exercise and which fundamentals it practices.

Notes and learning goals
- Document any input data requirements and sample commands to run each script.
- If tasks are project-style, include a short summary of the expected behavior and edge cases to test.
