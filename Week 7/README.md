# Week 7 — Fundamentals: (Directory listing unavailable; template)

Overview
A README template for Week 7 is provided below. The directory listing for Week 7 was not available at the time this file was created, so the exercise filenames are placeholders. Replace them with the actual filenames in the Week 7 folder.

Placeholder file list
- Week 7/<insert_filename_1>.py
- Week 7/<insert_filename_2>.py

Suggested topics these exercises might cover
- More advanced uses of data structures (nested lists/dictionaries), or
- Applied projects that combine prior topics (functions, classes, file I/O), or
- Introduction to modules, simple testing, or basic algorithms.

How to adapt this README
- Replace the placeholder filenames above with the real filenames present in Week 7.
- For each file, add a one-line description of the exercise and which fundamentals it practices.

Notes and learning goals
- Document any input data requirements and sample commands to run each script.
- If tasks are project-style, include a short summary of the expected behavior and edge cases to test.
